                                Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows
                                of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.
                            </li>

                                Camels have thick lips which let them forage for
                                thorny plants other animals canâ€™t eat.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Thanks to thick pads of skin on their chest and
                                knees, camels can comfortably sit in very hot
                                sand.
                            </li>

                                When a camel finally does find water, he can
                                drink up to 40 gallons in one go.
                            </li>

                                There are over 160 words for camel in Arabic
                                alone.
